# Exercise in Modelling Pension Withdrawal for UK
Does someone need to wait until state pension is due or do they have enough now to retire early without running out of money?
How much will they be able to safely spend each year?
Is it better to take a 25% tax free lump sum?  
Is it better to use up savings first and leave pension untouched?
Is it better to use pensions first and leave savings untouched?
Is it better to drawdown from pension, but no more than the income tax threshold (currently 12570), plus spend some from savings?
Is it better to drawdown from pension within basic rate threshold (currently 37700) - surplus becomes savings?
Even when you have no income and drawing from pension, you're allowed to pay in 3600 gross (2,880 from savings, 720 tax rebate).  Is it worth it?

All these questions are modelled by this app.

The interest on pension funds is assumed to by 4% above inflation.  The interest on savings is assumed to be 0, but no inflation either.  
So the figures are a rough approximation in today's money after taking inflation into account.
